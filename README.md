# Assignment 1: Hello Flask

This is your first Flask app. You'll create a Python web application that serves pages at different URLs. Each page is generated by a Python function — welcome to the dynamic web!

## Setup

1. Click the green **Code** button on this repo and choose **Open with Codespaces**. Create a new codespace if you don't have one yet.
2. Wait for the setup to finish. Codespaces will automatically install Flask for you (this takes about a minute the first time).
3. Open the **Terminal** in VS Code and run:
   ```
   flask run --debug
   ```
4. Codespaces will notice the server is running and offer to open the forwarded port — click **Open in Browser**. You should see an error page for now because there are no routes yet. That's expected!

## Assignment

Open `app.py`. You'll see the starter code already imports Flask and creates the app. Your job is to add routes below the `TODO` comment.

### Requirements

1. **Home page (`/`)** — Create a route for `/` that returns a welcome message including your name. Use `<h1>` for a heading and `<p>` for a paragraph.

2. **About page (`/about`)** — Create a route for `/about` that returns a short paragraph about yourself (interests, hobbies, etc.).

3. **Tasks page (`/tasks`)** — Create a route for `/tasks` that returns a hardcoded list of 3 things you need to do. Use `<ul>` and `<li>` tags to make it a proper list.

4. **Greeting page (`/greet/<name>`)** — Create a route for `/greet/<name>` that takes a name from the URL and returns a personalized greeting. For example, visiting `/greet/Alice` should display a greeting for Alice.

5. **Navigation links** — In each page's returned HTML, add `<a href="...">` links so a user can click between your pages without manually editing the URL bar.

## How to test

1. Make sure `flask run --debug` is running in your terminal.
2. Visit each of your routes in the browser: `/`, `/about`, `/tasks`, and `/greet/YourName`.
3. Click every link on every page to make sure navigation works.
4. If you change your code, just save the file and refresh the browser — `--debug` mode auto-reloads.

## What to submit

Push your completed code to this repository. Make sure `app.py` contains all your routes and that the app runs without errors.
